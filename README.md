# PYRAIN

Its just a simple Mumbai local trains framework, that processes all the information between any two stations and just prints out relevant information!

For E.g. - 

- The distance between two stations.
- The money for 2nd class ticket.
- The money for 1st class ticket.

So, basically its just a little something for the pythonic mumbai-kar! :)
